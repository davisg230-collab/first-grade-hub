# Extra News URL Linkification Feature

## Overview
The Extra News tab now automatically converts URLs in card descriptions into clickable links. This makes it easy for teachers and families to share web resources without any special formatting.

## How It Works

### For Teachers
When creating or editing Extra News cards, simply type URLs directly in the description:
- `https://example.com` - Full URL with protocol
- `http://site.org` - URL with HTTP
- `www.example.com` - URL starting with www

The URLs will automatically become clickable links when the card is saved and displayed.

### For Families
When families submit news through the Extra News form, any URLs they include in their descriptions will automatically be converted to clickable links.

## Supported URL Formats
- ✅ `https://example.com`
- ✅ `http://example.com`
- ✅ `www.example.com` (automatically adds http://)
- ✅ URLs with paths: `https://site.com/path/to/page`
- ✅ URLs with query strings: `https://site.com?query=value`
- ✅ Multiple URLs in one description

## Examples

### After (With Clickable Links)
