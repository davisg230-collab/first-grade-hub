# Google Sign-In Authentication Update

## Overview

This document describes the changes made to the `enterEditMode()` authentication logic to require Google Sign-In with email validation.

## Changes Made

### Modified Function: `enterEditMode()`
**File:** `public/index.html` (lines 1131-1173)

### Previous Behavior
- Used Firebase Anonymous Authentication when entering edit mode
- Any user with the correct PIN could enter edit mode
- No email validation

### New Behavior
- Requires Google Sign-In authentication
- Only allows edit mode if the authenticated user's email is `davisg230@gmail.com`
- Signs out unauthorized users
- Shows appropriate error messages for different failure scenarios

## Implementation Details

### Authentication Flow

1. **Check Firebase Auth Availability**
   - Ensures Firebase auth is initialized
   - Shows error if not available

2. **Check Google Sign-In Status**
   ```javascript
   const isGoogleUser = auth.currentUser && auth.currentUser.providerData.some(
     provider => provider.providerId === 'google.com'
   );
   ```
   - Checks if current user is signed in with Google (not anonymous)
   - Uses `providerData` to identify the authentication provider

3. **Trigger Google Sign-In (if needed)**
   ```javascript
   if (!isGoogleUser) {
     const provider = new firebase.auth.GoogleAuthProvider();
     await auth.signInWithPopup(provider);
   }
   ```
   - Shows Google Sign-In popup if user is not signed in with Google
   - Allows user to select their Google account
   - Handles sign-in cancellation gracefully

4. **Validate Email Address**
   ```javascript
   if (!auth.currentUser || auth.currentUser.email !== 'davisg230@gmail.com') {
     alert('Access denied. Only davisg230@gmail.com can edit this page.');
     await auth.signOut();
     return;
   }
   ```
   - Checks that the authenticated user's email matches the authorized email
   - Signs out unauthorized users
   - Prevents edit mode from being enabled

5. **Enable Edit Mode**
   - Only proceeds if all authentication checks pass
   - All existing edit mode functionality remains unchanged

## User Experience

### Scenario 1: First-time PIN Entry
1. User clicks "Edit Mode" button
2. User enters correct PIN (2213 or 8875)
3. Google Sign-In popup appears
4. User signs in with their Google account
5. If email is `davisg230@gmail.com`: Edit mode is enabled
6. If email is different: Access denied message, user is signed out

### Scenario 2: Already Signed In (Authorized)
1. User is already signed in with `davisg230@gmail.com`
2. User clicks "Edit Mode" and enters correct PIN
3. Edit mode is enabled immediately (no popup)

### Scenario 3: Already Signed In (Unauthorized)
1. User is signed in with a different Google account
2. User clicks "Edit Mode" and enters correct PIN
3. Access denied message is shown
4. User is signed out
5. Edit mode is NOT enabled

### Scenario 4: Sign-In Cancellation
1. User clicks "Edit Mode" and enters correct PIN
2. Google Sign-In popup appears
3. User closes the popup or clicks "Cancel"
4. Error message: "Google Sign-In is required to enter edit mode. Please try again."
5. Edit mode is NOT enabled

## Security Considerations

### Improvements
- **Email-based Authorization**: Only the specific email `davisg230@gmail.com` can access edit mode
- **Google Account Verification**: Leverages Google's authentication for identity verification
- **Automatic Sign-out**: Unauthorized users are immediately signed out

### Important Notes
- PIN protection remains as the first layer of security
- Google Sign-In is the second layer (identity verification)
- Email validation is the third layer (authorization check)

## Unchanged Functionality

### Parent Snack Claims
- Still uses Firebase Anonymous Authentication
- Parents do NOT need to sign in with Google
- This feature remains completely unchanged
- See `saveSnackDataToFirestore()` function (line ~1903)

### All Other Features
- UI remains unchanged
- All edit mode features work the same way
- PIN system still functions identically
- Owner vs Teacher distinction (isOwner flag) unchanged

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Enter correct PIN with authorized Google account (should succeed)
- [ ] Enter correct PIN without being signed in (should show Google popup)
- [ ] Enter correct PIN with unauthorized Google account (should be denied)
- [ ] Cancel Google Sign-In popup (should show error message)
- [ ] Test parent snack claims without edit mode (should still work)
- [ ] Verify all edit mode features work after successful authentication
- [ ] Test both teacher PIN (2213) and owner PIN (8875)

### Expected Console Messages

**Successful Authentication:**
```
Initiating Google Sign-In...
Google Sign-In successful
Authentication successful for authorized user
```

**Failed Authentication (Wrong Email):**
```
Unauthorized user: wrongemail@gmail.com
```

**Failed Authentication (Cancelled Popup):**
```
Google Sign-In failed: {error details}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Firebase auth not available"
- **Cause**: Firebase failed to initialize
- **Solution**: Refresh the page, check console for initialization errors

### Issue: Google Sign-In popup is blocked
- **Cause**: Browser popup blocker
- **Solution**: Allow popups for this site

### Issue: "Access denied" for correct email
- **Cause**: Email might be capitalized differently or have extra spaces
- **Solution**: Verify the exact email format in auth.currentUser.email

### Issue: Parent snack claims not working
- **Cause**: This should not be affected by the changes
- **Solution**: Check browser console for unrelated errors

## Firebase Configuration

No changes to Firebase configuration are required. The application already has:
- ✓ Firebase Auth SDK loaded
- ✓ Google provider configured in Firebase Console
- ✓ Authorized domains configured for hosting

## Maintenance

### To Change Authorized Email
1. Locate line 1160 in `public/index.html`
2. Change `'davisg230@gmail.com'` to the new email address
3. Update this documentation

### To Add Multiple Authorized Emails
Replace line 1160 with:
```javascript
const authorizedEmails = ['davisg230@gmail.com', 'another@gmail.com'];
if (!auth.currentUser || !authorizedEmails.includes(auth.currentUser.email)) {
```
